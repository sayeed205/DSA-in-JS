# ROADMAP

-   [x] [Basic JavaScript](pages/basic-javascript.md) - Start by learning the basics of JavaScript, including data types, loops, conditional statements, and functions. You can refer to resources like the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) for learning JavaScript.

-   [x] [Arrays and Objects](pages/arrays-and-objects.md) - Learn how to work with arrays and objects in JavaScript. Understand the various operations that can be performed on them, such as adding, removing, and modifying elements. You can refer to the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) for learning about arrays and objects.

-   [ ] [Sorting and Searching](pages/sorting-and-searching.md) - Learn about different sorting and searching algorithms and their implementations in JavaScript. You can start with basic algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and move on to more complex algorithms like quicksort, merge sort, binary search, and linear search.

-   [ ] [Linked Lists](pages/linked-lists.md) - Understand what linked lists are and how they differ from arrays. Learn how to implement a linked list in JavaScript and perform basic operations like adding, removing, and searching for nodes.

-   [ ] [Stacks and Queues](pages/stacks-and-queues.md) - Learn about stacks and queues, their operations, and their implementations in JavaScript. Understand the difference between stacks and queues and when to use them.

-   [ ] [Trees](pages/trees.md) - Learn about trees, their types, and their implementations in JavaScript. Understand basic operations like adding, removing, and searching for nodes in a binary search tree.

-   [ ] [Graphs](pages/graphs.md) - Learn about graphs, their types, and their implementations in JavaScript. Understand basic operations like adding, removing, and searching for nodes in a graph.

-   [ ] [Dynamic Programming](pages/dynamic-programming.md) - Learn about dynamic programming and its implementations in JavaScript. Understand how to solve problems using dynamic programming and the techniques involved.

-   [ ] [Practice](pages/practice.md) - Finally, practice solving problems using the concepts you have learned. Websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal offer a wide variety of problems to practice on.
